====
Building
====

You will need:
- A Haskell compiler (only tested with GHC).
- OpenGL and GLUT Haskell libraries.

To build:

  runhaskell Setup.hs configure
  runhaskell Setup.hs build

On my setup, this puts a binary at:

  dist/build/3d-spherical/3d-spherical

Optional:

  runhaskell Setup.hs install

====
Using
====

Use the numeric keypad.  If you don't like this, you can edit the "kmap" function in Main.hs.

keys:
4568 - move around
space - jump
+ - toggle hover mode
79 - up and down in hover mode
- - toggle visibility of the big torus  (I think it's the same as what's described at http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/tfb/icms-poster/torus/welcome.html )
