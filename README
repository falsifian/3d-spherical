====
Building
====

You will need cabal-install and a Haskell compiler. (The only complire I've tested is ghc.)

Install it with

cabal install .:3d-spherical

Or just run it directly with

cabal run .:3d-spherical

====
Using
====

Use the numeric keypad.  If you don't like this, you can edit the "kmap" function in Main.hs.

keys:
4568 - move around
space - jump
+ - toggle hover mode
79 - up and down in hover mode
- - toggle visibility of the big torus  (I think it's the same as what's described at http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/tfb/icms-poster/torus/welcome.html )
